# Educultivo
A website that was created to encourage students to dedicate themselves to the class with a user-friendly interface.
This project was created by me and three other members of my group: [Lorena Ferreira](https://github.com/lorenafsv), Bruno Lobianco, and Gabriel. We developed it for an extension course activity at our university and presented it at a local elementary school.
